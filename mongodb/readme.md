# Start local mongodb

### When `docker-compose.yml` is in the root folder

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### When `docker-compose.yml` is in the nested folders

```bash
docker-compose -f ./mongodb/docker-compose.yml up
```

# Connection string

```bash
mongodb://<username>:<password>@localhost:27017
```

# Connect using MongoDB Compass GUI client

- Download [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass)
- Enter the above connection string with correct `username` and `password` and hit connect
- That's it you are good to go now!

# Access the mongo shell via docker

**Run the following command to enable mongo shell:**

```
docker-compose -f mongodb/docker-compose.yml run mongo mongosh --host mongo
```

- `-f mongodb/docker-compose.yml` points to the file which we want to run docker compose on. If we have `docker-compose.yml` in root folder we don't need to pass this flag
- `run` will run the command that we enter
- `mongo` is the container name that we have entered in docker compose file. This is the container in which we want to `run` the command
- `mongosh --host mongo` is the command that we want to `run`, to enter into the mongo shell
  - we entered `--host mongo` because we cannot connect to `localhost:27017` inside the docker environment we need to enter host as the container name

After running this you will see the following output:

```bash
Current Mongosh Log ID: 65916b5cc7606344bcb75c39
Connecting to:          mongodb://mongo:27017/?directConnection=true&appName=mongosh+1.10.1
Using MongoDB:          6.0.8
Using Mongosh:          1.10.1

For mongosh info see: https://docs.mongodb.com/mongodb-shell/

test>
```

Enter following command to list out dbs:

```bash
test> show dbs
```

We get following error:

```bash
test> show dbs
MongoServerError: command listDatabases requires authentication
```

This means we haven't logged in to the mongo shell and we don't have permissions to do these tasks. Let's see how we can enter inside the mongo shell with permissions.

Run the following command to quit the mongo shell:

```bash
test> quit
```

# Access mongo shell with permissions

```bash
docker-compose -f mongodb/docker-compose.yml run mongo mongosh -u root -p example --host mongo
```

- `-u root` this is the username that we have provided in the compose file with `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: root` env var
- `-p example` this is the password that we have provided in the compose file with `MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: example` env var

After running this you will see the following output:

```bash
Current Mongosh Log ID: 65916c87334d0c4c484182d6
Connecting to:          mongodb://<credentials>@mongo:27017/?directConnection=true&appName=mongosh+1.10.1

test>
```

Now, run `show dbs` and you will get the list of dbs as follows:

```bash
test> show dbs
admin   100.00 KiB
config  108.00 KiB
local    72.00 KiB
```

Now, you can run mongodb related commands here

# Create new database

```
use mongotest
```

# Import sample collection from json file

- Run below command to copy collection folder from local folder "mongodb/db_collections" to docker folder "db_data"

```
docker cp  ./mongodb/db_collections mongo:db_data
```

- Import collection data

```
mongoimport --uri="mongodb://root:example@localhost:27017/mongotest?ssl=false&authSource=admin" --collection people --jsonArray --batchSize 1 --file ./db_data/people.json
```
